## 1.0.0 — 2026-10-15

- Introduce independent packaging and version ownership for the existing `plaid` plugin, compatible with WHAB 2.x. Earlier changes shipped inside the application distribution and were not independent plugin releases.
- Preserve its plugin ID, Python package and entry point.
- Reject plaintext OAuth redirect URLs in Sandbox as well as production; redirect URLs must use HTTPS.
